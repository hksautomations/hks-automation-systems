# System Architectures

This folder contains high-level architecture documentation
for AI automation systems built using n8n and Large Language Models.

The goal is to explain:
- System boundaries
- Control flow
- Decision logic
- Safety and reliability considerations

These documents focus on **design thinking**, not implementation details.

Each architecture will be documented in a separate markdown file.

## Notes

- No credentials, client data, or full workflow exports are included
- Tool-specific configurations are intentionally omitted
- Diagrams (if present) are illustrative only
