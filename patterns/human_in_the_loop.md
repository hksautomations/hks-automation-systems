# Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Pattern

## Problem
Fully automated AI systems fail silently when edge cases appear.

Some decisions require human judgment.

## Pattern
Insert manual checkpoints where:
- AI confidence is low
- Stakes are high
- Output affects external users

Human actions may include:
- Approve
- Edit
- Reject
- Escalate

## When to Use
- Outreach messaging
- Customer communication
- Research summaries
- High-value leads

## Benefits
- Error containment
- Trust building
- Faster iteration
- Regulatory safety

## Common Failures Prevented
- Brand damage
- Incorrect client communication
- AI overreach
