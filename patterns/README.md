# Automation & AI Design Patterns

This folder documents **reusable design patterns**
used across AI automation systems.

The focus is on:
- Reliability
- Control
- Maintainability
- Safe AI usage

These patterns are **tool-agnostic** and can be applied
across different workflows and platforms.

## Example Pattern Categories

- Parent–child workflow orchestration
- AI scoring with deterministic gating
- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints
- Fail-safe defaults and kill switches

Each pattern is explained conceptually, without exposing
implementation-specific details.
