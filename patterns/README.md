# AI Automation Design Patterns

This folder documents reusable design patterns used to build reliable,
production-grade AI automation systems.

These patterns are **tool-agnostic**, but are implemented primarily using:
- n8n for workflow orchestration
- Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning
- Deterministic logic for control and safety

The goal of these patterns is to:
- Prevent over-automation
- Improve system reliability
- Make AI behavior explainable and auditable
- Enable safe scaling of AI-driven workflows

Each pattern describes:
- The problem it solves
- When to use it
- How it works at a system level
- Common failure modes it prevents
