# HKS Automation Systems

This repository documents **production-grade AI automation systems**
built using n8n and Large Language Models (LLMs).

The focus is on:
- Replacing repetitive manual workflows
- Designing reliable AI-driven systems
- Combining AI reasoning with deterministic control logic

This repository contains **architecture and system documentation**,
not raw workflow exports.

## What I Build

### AI Automation Systems
- Lead generation and outreach automation
- Workflow orchestration using AI + rules
- Operations and CRM intelligence

### AI Assistants (RAG-Based)
- Customer support assistants
- Internal knowledge systems
- Document intelligence workflows

---

## Design Philosophy

- AI where reasoning is required
- Rules where control is critical
- Human-in-the-loop for risk-sensitive actions
- Modular parent–child orchestration
- Safe defaults and clear failure modes

---

## Repository Structure

- `architectures/` — system-level designs
- `patterns/` — reusable automation patterns
- `samples/` — sanitized example outputs
- `docs/` — supporting documentation
