# HKS Automation Systems

Production-grade AI automation systems designed with **control, safety, and scalability** in mind.

This repository documents how I design and build AI-powered automation using workflow orchestration, large language models (LLMs), and deterministic logic.

---

## What This Repository Contains

This is **not a collection of scripts or experiments**.

It is a structured documentation of:
- AI system architectures
- Reusable automation design patterns
- Client-safe system samples
- Delivery, safety, and handover practices

The focus is on **reliability over hype**.

---

## Core Principles

- AI is probabilistic — control logic must be deterministic
- Automation should be explainable and auditable
- Human override is always available
- Systems must fail safely
- Scaling should reduce risk, not amplify it

---

## Repository Structure

---

## Example Systems Documented

- AI Lead Generation & Outreach Systems
- RAG-Based Customer Support Assistants
- AI Research & Report Generation Systems
- Structured AI Content Generation Pipelines

Each system is designed to be:
- Modular
- Extendable
- Safe to operate in production environments

---

## Tooling (Implementation-Oriented)

- Workflow orchestration: n8n
- Reasoning: Large Language Models (OpenAI / Groq / others)
- Control logic: Deterministic rules and gates
- Storage: Databases, CRMs, document stores

Systems are **tool-agnostic by design**.

---

## Intended Audience

This repository is useful for:
- Clients evaluating AI automation solutions
- Technical reviewers and collaborators
- Teams looking to adopt safe AI automation patterns
