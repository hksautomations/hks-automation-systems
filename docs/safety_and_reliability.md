# Safety and Reliability

AI automation systems must be safe by default.

## Safety Measures Used

- Rule-based decision gates
- Confidence thresholds
- Budget and rate limits
- Manual approval checkpoints
- Kill switches

## Reliability Practices

- Modular workflows
- Isolated failures
- Logging and traceability
- Deterministic routing

## Why This Matters

Safety failures scale faster than success.
These controls prevent:
- Cost overruns
- Brand damage
- Incorrect client actions
