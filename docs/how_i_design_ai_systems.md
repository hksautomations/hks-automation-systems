# How I Design AI Automation Systems

AI systems fail when treated as magic.
I design AI automation as **engineering systems**, not prompts.

## Design Principles

1. AI is probabilistic — control logic must be deterministic
2. Every AI output must be gated
3. Confidence matters more than creativity
4. Human override is always possible
5. Systems must fail safely

## Design Process

1. Understand the existing manual workflow
2. Identify automation leverage points
3. Separate reasoning from execution
4. Add decision gates and safety checks
5. Test edge cases before scaling

## Result

The result is not just automation speed, but:
- Predictability
- Explainability
- Trust
