# AI Automation Samples

This folder contains **sanitized, client-safe examples** that demonstrate how
the documented architectures and patterns are applied in real workflows.

These samples are:
- Tool-agnostic
- Non-runnable
- Free of sensitive data
- Designed for explanation, not execution

Each sample shows:
- Input
- AI reasoning (simplified)
- Control logic
- Final output

The goal is to make system behavior **clear and trustworthy**.
